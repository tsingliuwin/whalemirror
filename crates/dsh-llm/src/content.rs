//! Content-block projection helpers for file attachments.
//!
//! Mirrors the file half of upstream
//! [`packages/llm/llm/src/content.ts`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/blob/main/packages/llm/llm/src/content.ts):
//! no provider ever receives a file block natively, so request assembly
//! replaces every file occurrence — including nested tool results — with
//! deterministic handle text naming the file, its size, and its read-only
//! stored address.
